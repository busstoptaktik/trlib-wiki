== (KMS) TrLib ==

Welcome to this first version of the TrLib wiki. 
Hopefully lots of useful information will eventually find its way here.

=== Notes on release ===

We are preparing a release procedure. The code in the repository is NOT yet an official release version. However, the "machine room" is functioning and stable, so developers should be able to build very usable versions on their own.

=== Build procedures ===

We will at some point put some build instructions here, and also at some point add buildtools (e.g. make files) to the repository.

=== Supported systems ===

We have been able to compile and test the code on the following systems:
* Windows XP (Servicepack 3): MINGW (gcc 4.5.2), Visual Studio 2010
* Windows Server 2008 (64 bit): MINGW (gcc 4.5.2), Visual Studio 2010 (cross compiled from WinXP)
* Ubuntu 10.10 (32 bit, i686): gcc 4.4.5
* Ubuntu 10.10 (64 bit x86_64): gcc 4.4.5
* SunOS (Sparc): Sun C 5.9

=== Tested, but not really supported ===

* Mac OS X, Snow Leopard: gcc 4.2. **Only in single threaded mode.**
