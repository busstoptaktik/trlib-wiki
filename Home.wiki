== (KMS) TrLib ==

Welcome to this first version of the TrLib wiki. 
Hopefully lots of useful information will eventually find its way here.

See also the [[Programming guide|programming guide.]]
=== Notes on release ===

Due to *popular* request to implement new features the planned release of KMSTRLIB v.1.0 (version 1.0 of the transformation library with the NEW API) has been postponed to Monday March 12 2012. 

Precompiled binaries for windows and updated geoid library will be available for download from the [[http://www.kms.dk/Emner/Referencenet/Koordinattransformation/|KMS website]] by then.

Also, a new version of the GUI application KMSTRANS, build on the same transformation code, will be available for download shortly after (beginning of week 11). 

=== Build procedures ===

A makefile for linux (gcc) has been added to the root directory. Alternatively you can use [[http://www.cmake.org|cmake]] to generate makefiles or project-files specific to your system. This uses the CMakeLists.txt files in the root-dir and in the TR_SRC dir to build a shared library. For example:
# Make a directory BUILD at the same level as trlib. Then cd to that directory.
# Run cmake ../trlib - this will generate makefiles/project files, which defaults to whatever compiler you have on your system (Visual Studio, gcc etc.)
# You can also specify the target compiler suite by using the -G switch: cmake -G <generator> ../trlib 
=== Mini Labels ===

(KMS)TrLib uses the (famous) mini label system for specification of projection/reference system metadata. See the [[mini labels|mini labels page]] for an introduction. 

=== Supported systems ===

We have been able to compile and test the code on the following systems:
* Windows XP (Servicepack 3): MINGW (gcc 4.5.2), Visual Studio 2010
* Windows Server 2008 (64 bit): MINGW (gcc 4.5.2), Visual Studio 2010 (cross compiled from WinXP)
* Ubuntu 10.10 (32 bit, i686): gcc 4.4.5
* Ubuntu 10.10 (64 bit, x86_64): gcc 4.4.5
* SunOS (Sparc): Sun C 5.9

=== Tested, but not really supported ===

* Mac OS X, Snow Leopard: gcc 4.2 (**only in single threaded mode**), gcc 4.6 (multithreaded).

=== Definition files ===

The library needs the definition file //def_lab.txt// in order to be able to run. To be able to perform 3d-transformations a geoid library is also needed. Definition file(s) and geoid library will be distributed on releases. You can also contact <<user silyko>> if you need an up to date geoid library for testing etc.
