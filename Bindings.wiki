== Bindings two high level languages ==

Currently bindings to C#, java and python are supported.

=== Design ===

Common to the bindings, which are all to object oriented languages, is that a transformation is created by creating a class instance. For example in python:

{{{
#!python
import TrLib
TrLib.InitLibrary(my_geoid_folder)
ct=TrLib.CoordinateTransformation("utm32Ewgs84","utm32Eed50")
x,y,z=ct.Transform(512200.1,6143200.1,100.0)
ct.Close()
}}}
