== Bindings to high level languages ==

Currently bindings to C#, java and python are supported.

=== Design ===

Common to the bindings, which are all to object oriented languages, is that a transformation is created by creating a class instance. For example in python:

{{{
#!python
import TrLib
TrLib.InitLibrary(my_geoid_folder,"KMSTRLIB.dll","C:\\LIB")
ct=TrLib.CoordinateTransformation("utm32Ewgs84","utm32Eed50")
x,y,z=ct.Transform(512200.1,6143200.1,100.0)
ct.Close()
}}}

=== Java ===

The java interface to TrLib uses JNI. The JNI-functions can be put in an intermediate shared library linked to TrLib or they can be put directly into TrLib itself.

Here's an example of how to use the java bindings. First of all include the TrLib-class, defined in TrLib.java, in your project:

{{{
#!java

public class TestProgram{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		String version=TrLib.GetVersion();
		System.out.println("TrLib version is: "+version);
		TrLib.InitLibrary("");
		TrLib.TR_Error err;
		TrLib.CoordinateTransformation ct;
		ct=new TrLib.CoordinateTransformation("utm32Ewgs84","utm32Eed50");
		double X[]={5143200.1,450200.1};
		double Y[]={6143200.1,6200000.1};
		double Z[]={100,200};
	        err=ct.Transform(X,Y,Z);
                ct.Close();}
}
}}}
