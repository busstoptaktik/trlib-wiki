== Bindings two high level languages ==

Currently bindings to C#, java and python are supported.

=== Design ===

Common to the bindings, which are all to object oriented languages, is that a transformation is created by creating a class instance. For example in python:

{{{
#!python
import TrLib
TrLib.InitLibrary(my_geoid_folder)
ct=TrLib.CoordinateTransformation("utm32Ewgs84","utm32Eed50")
x,y,z=ct.Transform(512200.1,6143200.1,100.0)
ct.Close()
}}}

=== Java ===

The java interface to TrLib uses JNI through an intermediate shared library - of course the JNI functions can also be put into the main shared library, TrLib.

Here's an example of how to use the java bindings. First of all include the TrLib class, defined in TrLib.java, in your project:

{{{
#!java

public class TestProgram{
	public static void main(String args[]){
		String version=TrLib.GetVersion();
		System.out.println("TrLib version is: "+version);
		TrLib.InitLibrary("");
		TrLib.TR_Error err;
		TrLib.CoordinateTransformation ct;
		ct=new TrLib.CoordinateTransformation("utm32Ewgs84","utm32Eed50");
		double X[]={5143200.1,450200.1};
		double Y[]={6143200.1,6200000.1};
		double Z[]={100,200};
	        err=ct.Transform(X,Y,Z);
                ct.Close();}
}
}}}
